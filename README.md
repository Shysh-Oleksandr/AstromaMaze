# **Astroma Maze**
Space and puzzles. Combine them to the **Astroma Maze**.

Your task is to help a lonely astronaut stuck on an uninhabited planet to get home. To do this, you must get out of the maze within a certain time, where a spaceship will be waiting for you at the exit. 

To make things easier, you can use the following **features**:
* **Paint** walls and ground to mark the places you passed.
* Leave **footprints** for the same purpose.
* Look at the situation from a different point of view, namely from a **bird's eye view**.
* Use a **compass** to determine the direction to the exit.
* Collect **coins** for which you can **upgrade** your abilities in the inventory.

**So, are you ready to help a lonely astronaut?**
